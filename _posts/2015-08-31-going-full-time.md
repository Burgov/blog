Time is a weird thing. When you are doing something you love, it just seems to rush by. Over one year passed since we officially [announced](http://blog.thoughtram.io/announcements/2014/06/23/announcing-our-first-workshop.html) thoughtram as project to create high quality trainings.

Back then Pascal and I were both employed as Software Engineers at [CouchCommerce](http://www.couchcommerce.com/) where we had a stable job, cool technical challenges, lovely and talented co-workers, a modern tech stack and very competitive salaries.

When we started thoughtram it was really just a side project for us to share our knowledge on another level. We already spoke a lot at meetups and conferences so it was something like the logical consequence for us to expand on that and run workshops. We didn't even bother to register a company when we started. We ran our first [workshop on Git](http://thoughtram.io/git-master-class.html) in September 2014 and the feedback was so overwhelmingly great that we founded thoughtram as a company right after that in October 2014.

Since then and especially after we announced our [Angular Master Class](http://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html) course the demand kind of hockey-sticked and we had far more requests for workshops than what we were able to handle next to our full-time jobs.

Over the last twelve months we gave workshops and talks in countries such as the USA, Thailand, the Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey, Austria and Hungary and we're actually just getting started.

**As of today we are proud and happy to announce that from the 1st of September on we are going to work full-time for our own company thoughtram**.

We like to thank our previous co-workers for the wonderful time spent together. It was great to help CouchCommerce to get where it is right now. It has a bright future ahead and continues to be an awesome company to work for (hint: they are always looking for talents to join the team!).

On to something new! We are excited to dedicate our full time to our baby that is thoughtram. We are excited to travel to more places to spread our workshops across the globe. We are excited to spend more time working on the open source projects that we love. We are excited to meet you!

It's great to see so many people spread the love about throughtram either on [twitter](https://twitter.com/elmd_/status/635785064404676608), their own [blogs](http://jvandemo.com/thoughtram-angular-master-class-review/) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thoughtram?sk=reviews). We like to note that what you've seen so far is the work of a two-men side project. It will only get better now that we went all in.

We have lots of cool stuff brewing that we are eager to share with you soon. Some of it we can't share publicly yet and others we'll announce with dedicated blog posts in the near future. Stay tuned!

Christoph & Pascal
